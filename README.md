### Hey, I'm Evan! 👋

I'm a hardworking, ambitious, and determined sophomore at the University of Michigan pursuing a degree in computer science. As a high academic achiever with research, e-commerce, and teaching experience, I love tackling complex problems and finding meaningful solutions.

Beyond programming, I really enjoy theater (acting and watching), fitness, fashion, travel, soccer refereeing, and seeking adventure.

I love meeting people and creating new connections, so feel free to connect!
