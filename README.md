### Hey, I'm Evan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hardworking, ambitious, and determined junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a degree in computer science with a minor in French. As a high academic achiever with industry experience in e-commerce, health, and banking, I love tackling complex problems and finding meaningful solutions.

Beyond programming, I really enjoy theater, fitness, and youth soccer refereeing.

I love meeting people and creating new connections, so feel free to connect!
